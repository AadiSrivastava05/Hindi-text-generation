# Hindi Article Generator📰
This project is a Hindi Article Generator, developed using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to create contextually relevant and coherent articles in Hindi. The model was trained on a custom dataset collected via web scraping. The model has been fine-tuned on a dataset of Hindi news headlines and articles to generate high-quality, fluent articles for a variety of use cases such as news, blogs, and creative content.

# 📁 Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset that I created through web scraping from the BBC Hindi website. The dataset includes a wide variety of articles, ensuring that the generator produces diverse and contextually accurate content.
